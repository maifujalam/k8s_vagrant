1. trivy image nginx
2. Late:  k -n applications get deployments.apps  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,IMAGE:.spec.template.spec.containers[*].image
3. Quick: k -n applications get pod -o yaml | grep -i image:
4. Scale deployment that has vulnerability :
    a. List all deployments in a namespace: k -n applications get deployments.apps
    b. Get image of each deployment one by one: $ k -n applications get deployments.apps web1 -o yaml | grep -i image:
    c. Scan image of that deployment with specific vurnability: trivy image nginx:1.20.2-alpine | grep -i CVE-2016-9841
    d. Know total vulnerability: trivy image nginx:1.20.2-alpine | head
    e. Scale deployment:
 5. trivy --input <any_container_archive>.tar
 6. trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL
