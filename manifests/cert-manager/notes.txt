Steps to generate self signed certificate.
1. Create self signed cluster issuer. k apply -f cert-manager/clusterSelfSignedIssuer.yaml
2. Watch the cluster issuer is created. k get clusterissuers.cert-manager.io
3. Create root certificate in nsmaespace where you wanna use this clusterissuer to sign rootCA.
    Hare we are going to use kubernetes-dashboard namespace to generate self signed rootCA.
    k apply -f kubernetes-dashboard/kubernetes-dashboard-ca.yaml
4. Follow the secret created by this rootCA.
    k -n kubernetes-dashboard get secret root-secret
5. Follow the CA certificate is in ready state.
    k -n kubernetes-dashboard get certificate
6.
